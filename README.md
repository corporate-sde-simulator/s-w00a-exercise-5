## Recommended Path

### If you've NEVER coded before:
```
Exercise 0 → Exercise 7 → Exercise 1 → Exercise 2 → Exercise 6
    ↑              ↑            ↑            ↑            ↑
 Learn basics   Terminal    Python deep   JavaScript   Bug finding
```

### If you've coded but are new to Python/JS:
```
Exercise 7 → Exercise 1 → Exercise 2 → 3, 4, 5 → Exercise 6
    ↑            ↑            ↑          ↑             ↑
 Terminal    Python deep   JavaScript  Other langs  Bug finding
```
